# This is a comment
#variables vs constants ` 
# variables are declaredin titlecase
#constants are declaedred in capitals

#Example of variable 

team1name = "speros stars"
team2name = "croydon kebabs"

# Variables have a useful name
#variables store a value (can change)
#variables CAN NOT store with a number
#e.g. 1teamname = "croydon kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#variables can not have a space in the name
#e.g Team Name ="CROY kebabs"
#this will not be a syntax error

#this  is an example of a constant
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER= 3

#The values is a CONSTANT NOT change
